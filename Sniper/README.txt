A "lightning game" (Create a game within a couple week timespan). Aimed for an arcade style time-based target game. 

Move your sniper crosshair to aim for your targets in the windows of buildings. Aim fast or you will run out of time. You are given a set amount of time each phase depending on the number of targets. If you can't eliminate all your targets within the time, its game over.


Created for a class project within a couple months in PICO-8 (a Lua based virtual console).
