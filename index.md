### Enterprise Resource Planning Simulation - February 2021 - May 2021

Worked in a team of 4 over 10 weeks using an online ERPsim to simulate running a business and operating a firm
in a reselling context. This involved interacting with suppliers and customers by sending orders, transferring 
products to regions, and completing the whole end-to-end business cycle.

Using the ERP data, each simulated company (team of students) would analyze the information to make business decisions
and ensure the profibility of their operations. 

Both Microsoft Excel and Tableau were heavily used to excute customized reports, draw informed conclusions,
and translate those into actionable business strategies.

### [DND Map Maker](https://github.com/TheJMaster28/DND-DM-Map-Maker) - February 2021 - May 2021

Worked in a team of 6 using Unity to create a tool for Dungeons & Dragons players to build
custom 3D maps with the focus of improvised map editings.

Allowed players to host and join sessions with control over their unique objects intended for full
gameplays of D&D campaigns.

### [Sniper](/Sniper/sniper.html) - October 2020

Designed and developed an arcade style game with a co-creator

● Players control a crosshair to shoot randomly spawned enemies within the time limit

● Game ends when players miss a target 3 times, or fail to hit all targets within time limit

● Randomly spawned enemies within a set grid with the timer correlating with the number of enemies
